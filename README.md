# Mood-O-Meter
A rails application that allows users to track their mood. This is done by filling out a daily entry that would include:
* A customized checklist of activities completed
* A mood rating
* A text post
This data is later aggregated to create a graph that allows users to compare their mood to specific actions completed and see how they or if they correlate.
